## Why ?

* I work every day with apis
* There is no quick debug for webhooks wihtout expose data. ( or maybe I didn't search to much )
* Most of apps are to abstract & didn't even give docs
* I'm to lazy for read tons of docs per keys or data type
* Sometime I just want to see what kind of data my api receive

## For who ?
* Devs
* Ops
* Data engineers
* IT Guys
* Low code users
* No code users
* Etc..

## Use cases only with json
* Debug your client
* Receive data from any app as webhook
* Debug your data generated before send
